Project Description:
This project aims to address the problem of skin cancer classification and develop an optimized machine learning model for accurately classifying different types of skin cancer. The project utilizes image data from the ISIC Challenge and compares it with a collection of 10,015 images representing seven distinct skin cancer types.

The initial code used for transfer learning is sourced from Sasank Chilamkurthy and can be accessed at: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html

To facilitate the project, the dataset "dataverse_files" can be downloaded from: https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10417.

The repository includes the lightweight models that have been uploaded for easy access. Additionally, the "output" folder contains the various results obtained from training the unloaded models.
